OptiBuy Manual AAB Upload Guide
Current Status
Google Play Console API access setup is complex
Modified Codemagic to generate AAB without auto-upload
You'll manually upload the AAB to Google Play Console
Required Codemagic Environment Variables
Only these 4 variables needed now:

android_signing group:
CM_KEYSTORE: Base64 encoded keystore file
CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD: Your keystore password
CM_KEY_ALIAS_PASSWORD: Your key alias password
CM_KEY_ALIAS: optibuy-key
No Google Play credentials needed!

Build Process
Push code to GitHub repository
Connect repository to Codemagic
Set only the 4 keystore variables above
Run android-workflow
Download AAB from Codemagic artifacts
Manually upload to Google Play Console
Manual Upload Steps
Go to Google Play Console → OptiBuy app
Release → Production → Create new release
Upload the downloaded .aab file
Add release notes
Save and Review release
Start rollout to production or Start rollout to closed testing
Expected Artifacts
app-release.aab - The main app bundle
mapping.txt - ProGuard mapping file (keep this safe)
